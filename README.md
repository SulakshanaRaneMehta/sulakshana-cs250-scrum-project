Sprint Review and Retrospective

Reflection

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this? 
I begin by learning about the users' goals and then I translate those into user stories that are clear and define what needs to be built. Having user stories is a great way to take big ideas and make them more manageable because you are making it about delivering value over the next two weeks, one sprint at a time. It also clears up what we really need to be focused on for work, and aligns the team around the way we should be approaching real user expectations.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work? 
I do my development by scoping in small sprints and remaining open to changes. The Agile processes like sprint planning, daily standups, sprint reviews, and retrospectives enabled me to handle work effectively. I plan to use these practices in the future to encourage collaboration, adaptability, and better outcomes.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  
A good team member is someone who communicates clearly, supports their team goals, is reliable, and can step in when needed to help. This also means actively engaging in meetings, providing and accepting feedback respectfully, and working towards project success together.
